## Judit’s 90’s flavored retro portfolio...
### ...that is actually a modern website built with modern tools.

This is a Portfolio built after finishing a 3 month Fullstack dev bootcamp at Codeop. Built with React, CSS, React-Three/Fiber & Drei, Express.js, Sequelize, Pixelorama and love for pixel art. My intention with this project was learning Three.js, deepen my knowledge of React and Sequelize and challenging myself to create something different and original without the backing of my lovely bootcamp teachers and TAs.

It's inspired by Point&Click games like Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle or Fate of Atlantis, but with 2D planes placed in a Three.js scene. I hope you like it! If you have any comments or questions, don't hesitate to contact me: judit.calero84@gmail.com
